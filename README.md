PKB â€” Arch Backup Kernel Script (systemdâ€‘boot)

PKB (Protected Kernel Backup) is a tiny, robust helper for Arch Linux users on systemdâ€‘boot that always keeps the latest kernel plus the previous knownâ€‘good kernel bootable on the ESP â€” with versionâ€‘aware cleanup and zero GRUB/mkinitcpio dependencies.

Searchâ€‘friendly keywords: Arch Linux backup kernel, systemdâ€‘boot fallback, kernelâ€‘install dracut, keep previous kernel, ESP cleanup, protected kernel entry.

Why PKB?

Arch is minimal by design and wonâ€™t automatically keep the prior kernel. If a brandâ€‘new kernel fails to boot, you either need an LTS kernel or a manual fallback. PKB solves this by:

Backing up linux + initrd for the newest kernel into /efi/backup-kernels/<ver>_<timestamp>/.

Generating a clear protected boot entry (e.g. protected-<ver>_<stamp>.conf).

Always keeping one backup per version, retaining only the newest two different versions overall.

Never deleting the currently running kernelâ€™s backup if it exists.

Skipping initrd-fallback by default (saves ~150MB per backup). Optional via COPY_FALLBACK=1.

Performing preâ€‘clean before copy, space checks, and a postâ€‘clean.

Works with: systemdâ€‘boot, kernelâ€‘install, dracut. ESP expected at /efi (autoâ€‘detected from bootctl if not set).

Features

âœ… Versionâ€‘aware cleanup: keeps the newest two versions (configurable) and removes older duplicates/timestamps.

âœ… Never removes the backup for your currently booted kernel.

âœ… Preâ€‘clean + freeâ€‘space check before copying; safe exit if ESP is too small.

âœ… Minimal footprint: by default backs up only linux + initrd.

âœ… Friendly boot entries with a consistent protectedâ€‘latest.conf pointer.

âœ… No daemons or timers â€” triggered by a pacman hook after kernel updates.

Installation (Quick Start)
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/yourname/pkb.git
cd pkb


# Install script places files in standard locations
sudo ./scripts/install.sh

This installs:

bin/protected-kernel-backup.sh â†’ /usr/local/bin/protected-kernel-backup.sh

hooks/kernel-backup.hook â†’ /etc/pacman.d/hooks/kernel-backup.hook

The hook triggers PKB after Install/Upgrade/Remove of kernel images.

Note: PKB expects systemdâ€‘boot + kernelâ€‘install layout: /efi/<machine-id>/<kernel-ver>/ containing linux, initrd (and optionally initrd-fallback).

Configuration

Environment variables (set globally in the hook, or export before running):

ESP_DIR â€” path to your ESP mount. Default: auto from bootctl --print-boot-path, fallback /efi.

BACKUP_DIR â€” destination for backups on ESP. Default: $ESP_DIR/backup-kernels.

KEEP_VERSIONS â€” how many different kernel versions to keep (newest first). Default: 2.

COPY_FALLBACK â€” copy initrd-fallback too (0/1). Default: 0.

PKB_DRY_RUN â€” donâ€™t modify anything; just print actions (0/1). Default: 0.

PKB_VERBOSE â€” more logging (0/1). Default: 1.

Example: set COPY_FALLBACK=1 inside the hookâ€™s Exec line if you really want fallback images.

Usage

Normally you donâ€™t run PKB manually â€” the pacman hook does that after kernel changes. To run onâ€‘demand:

sudo protected-kernel-backup.sh

Common outputs:

ðŸ§¹ Pre-clean â€¦ â€” pruning old backups/entries before copying.

ðŸ“¦ Backing up â€¦ â€” copying linux + initrd into a timestamped folder.

ðŸ§¹ Post-clean â€¦ â€” final pruning to keep exactly KEEP_VERSIONS versions.

ðŸ“„ â€¦ protected-latest.conf â€” pointer to the most recent protected entry.

Disaster Recovery (TL;DR)

If the newest kernel doesnâ€™t boot, in the systemdâ€‘boot menu pick the entry named like:

ðŸ›¡ Protected Kernel <previous-version>

That boots your last knownâ€‘good kernel stored on the ESP. From there you can downgrade or wait for a fixed update.
